## The Process

### Step 1 Data Wrangling 

To begin, indiviual datasets were downloaded from the hcupnet website. 
-Create New Analysis Table
-Inpatient/Descriptive Stats
Choose Year
Specific Diagnosis/Precoedre - Yes
Proocedure Code Selection - Code 10

Once the individual datasets were downloaded, I checked the variable types...
Then, I created a macro to merge all the datasets together. 

### Step 2 Data Cleaning 
 I checked for invalid character values and missing data. Then, I looked for out of range data. 
 I checked for invalid numeric values and missing data. Check to see if any data types need to be converted. Last, I checked the range for variables.
