# CMS Toe and Foot Amputation Project

## Project Overview 

This project uses toe and foot amputation data from CMS's inpatient and outpatient data.
The goal of this project is to understand the trends in utilization of inpatient and outpatient toe and foot amputation services. The chart below shows general trends in amputation. I wanted to extend this previous chart until 2016? and make predictions for the next 10 years for toe and foot amputations.

This started out as a project for a job interview but I expanded on it to display some of my experience with SAS.

## The Process

### Step 1 Data Wrangling 

To begin, individual datasets were downloaded from the hcupnet website. 
This is what I selected. Create New Analysis Table >> Inpatient/Descriptive Stats >> Choose Year
>> Specific Diagnosis/Precoedre - Yes >> Proocedure Code Selection - Code 10

Once the individual datasets were downloaded, I checked the variable types in **SAS 9.4**.
Then, I created a macro to merge all the datasets together. Rename variables if needed for the initial merge. 

### Step 2 Data Cleaning 
 I checked for invalid character values and missing data. Then, I looked for out of range data. 
 I checked for invalid numeric values and missing data. I checked to see if any data types need to be converted. Last, I checked the range for variables. I looked for duplicates and values that are repeating. I checked that dates are correctly formatted. Relabel variables as needed. I dropped any unimportant variables. 

#### Learned my data. 
Mean/Medium/Mode and n for variables of interest 
Histograms.... 


### Step 3 Modeling
